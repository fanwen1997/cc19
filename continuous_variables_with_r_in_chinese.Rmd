# Continuous variables with R (Chinese)

Bangwei Zhou and Zhihao Ai

We created a tutorial in Chinese on the content of continuous variables with R. We combined (and translated) texts from chapter three of the textbook *Graphical Data Analysis with R* by Antony Unwin and the **Continuous Variables** section on [edav.info](https://edav.info/). Additionally, we also included an example to better illustrate how a user can fully utilize R to assess continuous variables from PSET1 problem 1. 

We hope this document can effectively jumpstart any user (with limited language background to Chinese) with sufficient skills to assess continuous variables with R.

Our document can be found [here](https://github.com/ZhihaoAi/EDAV-CC24).
