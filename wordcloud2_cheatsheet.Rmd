The community contribution for our team is working on creating a cheat sheet of wordcloud2 package in r.

Our work is divided into two parts, one is for the word could package general introduction and text adjustment, the other part is for the word cloud shape adjustment.  Song works for the first part, which showes in the first two columns on the cheat sheet, and Wen works for the second part that displaies on the last two columns of the cheat sheet.
